Method 1:
A base-paired DNA sequence is a pair of sequences over the letters A, C, G, and T where A's line
up with T's, and the G's line up with C's. We say such a sequence pair has 0 mismatches. If in a 
DNA sequence pair A is not paired with T, T with A, G with C, or C with G, the pair has 1 or
more mismatches. A base-paired sequence also needs both sides to have the same length. Write a static 
method named mismatch that takes two strings (i.e., values of type String) as
arguments and returns, as an int, the number of mismatched base-pairs. You can assume the two
input strings are non-empty and contain only the characters ’A’, ’C’, ’G’, and ’T’.

Method 2:
Write a static method removeZeroes that takes an array as input and returns a new array
with the same contents except the zeroes are gone.

Method 3:
Write a sta?c method named vowelCount that takes a String as input and returns a new int
array represen?ng the number of times each of the vowel a, e, i, o, u occurs in the input string.
Specifically, the returned array should hold 5 elements: the first is the count of a’s in the input
string, the second is the count of e’s, and so on. You may assume that the string contains no uppercase letters.

Method 4:
Write a static method named printStrings that takes as input a Scanner instance holding
a sequence of integer/string token pairs. The method prints to the console one
line of output for each token pair, with the given string repeated the given number of times.

Method 5:
Write a static method named showTwos that takes a positive int value n as input and prints
on the console the factors of 2.
